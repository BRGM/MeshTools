The MeshTools package has originally been developed to share a common mesh data structure with the ComPASS multiphase multicomponent flow simulation code (cf. the (CHARMS project website)[http://www.anr-charms.org]). 

For the moment MeshTools essentially serves as a pre and post-processing module for the ComPASS code. Yet, there is no plan to make it an exhaustive tool for mesh management and or generic conversion operations. If you look for such packages you may also consider alternative projects[^altmesh] such as (RingMesh)[https://github.com/ringmesh/RINGMesh].
[^altmesh]: any other reference is welcome here...

There is still no documentation but you may start with the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).
